### Login Umleitung

The `.formLogin(withDefaults())` method in Spring Security's configuration chain is used for configuring form-based authentication. When you include `.formLogin(withDefaults())`, Spring Security automatically provides a default form-based login page for authentication, which is found under localhost:8080/login.
Contrary to that my own loginPage is found under localhost:3000/login as it's a React component.

Here's what it does, essentially:

1. **Default Login Page**: When you access a secured endpoint without being authenticated, Spring Security redirects you to a default login page.

2. **Authentication Mechanism**: It sets up the authentication mechanism to validate the username and password submitted through the form against the configured `UserDetailsService`.

3. **Redirect Strategy**: After a successful login, it redirects the user to the originally requested URL or a default URL if none was originally requested.

By including `.formLogin(withDefaults())`, you're essentially telling Spring Security to handle authentication via a form-based login mechanism. This mechanism might interfere with your RESTful API endpoints, specifically the `/login` POST endpoint.

When your front-end sends a POST request to `/login`, Spring Security intercepts it to perform the form-based login, instead of letting it go through to your REST controller. Since your API expects a JSON payload while the form login expects form parameters, this conflict arises.

If you don't want Spring Security to generate a default login page and handle form-based login, it's better to comment out or remove the `.formLogin()` line as you did, especially when you are developing RESTful services where you would like to handle login via JSON payloads and custom logic.

So, in the context of a RESTful service, it's common to disable the form-based login and handle security through other mechanisms like JWT, OAuth2, or simple Basic Authentication depending on your needs.
